<Info>
  This page is intentionally non-technical so you can align product, engineering, and design on how Mio behaves before you dive into the Quickstart.

## How the integration flows

1. **Invite the user** – your interface launches the OAuth consent screen hosted by Mio. Users review what Mio will read (email + calendar) before approving.
2. **Confirm the connection** – Mio redirects back to your redirect URL with a short-lived authorization code. The browser keeps minimal state.
3. **Exchange and store** – your backend trades the code for durable tokens, encrypts the refresh token, and associates everything with the current account.
4. **Get Mio Context** – whenever you need personalized output, your backend or front-end asks Mio for context and passes it into your own prompts, emails, or experience.
5. **Refresh in the background** – the backend renews tokens on a schedule so users stay connected without repeating OAuth.

<Tip>
  Align on ownership early: the browser handles UX, the backend safeguards secrets, and Mio’s context layer returns ready-to-use insights about each user.

## Responsibilities at a glance

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Client" icon="laptop">
    Hosts buttons, callbacks, and any immediate feedback to the user. It only keeps short-lived state (e.g., “connected”).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend" icon="server">
    Stores secrets, exchanges codes, refreshes tokens, and decides how to persist Mio context or trigger downstream jobs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mio Context" icon="comments">
    Receives authenticated requests, turns signals from tools like email and calendar into structured facts, and returns a tailored context object or summary you can plug into any workflow.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Security checkpoints

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Protect credentials">
    Keep your Mio client secret environment variable in a secret manager and never expose it to the browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Require HTTPS">
    Use HTTPS for redirect URLs, token exchange routes, and any endpoint that proxies Mio traffic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle refresh tokens carefully">
    Encrypt refresh tokens at rest, rotate periodically, and delete them immediately if you revoke access in the Mio dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guard your context surface">
    Apply rate limiting or authentication to any proxy endpoint that forwards Mio Context lookups on behalf of thin clients.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Ready to build?

- Read the [Quickstart](/quickstart) when you are ready to implement the browser → server → Mio Context flow.
- Jump into the [API reference](/api-reference/client-sdk) for parameters, error codes, and advanced configuration once the basics work.
